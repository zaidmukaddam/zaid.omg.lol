            I&apos;m an Indie Software Developer interested in web development,
            open source, design, cybersecurity, technical writing and cloud
            computing based in India. I enjoy visualizing problems
            and writing code to solve them.

            I came across computer kinds of stuff in junior college. Taken
            programming more seriously after joining college, worked as a
            freelance developer, and I am pursuing a BTech degree in
            Cyber Security. Building projects and experimenting
            with new technologies is what I do in my free time.

          <p className="mt-5">
            My goal is to build cool things that make people&apos;s lives easier
            or more interestingâ€”whether that&apos;s through building an app or
            writing code for other people.
